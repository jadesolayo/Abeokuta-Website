          <div class="festival-article-cont">
            The Lisabi festival commemorates the celebration of the Egba hero
            called Lisabi. The Lisabi Festival, held in high esteem by the Egba
            people, reminds them of how they conquered their enemies in their
            torrid past and the individuals that played roles in liberating the
            people, especially Lisabi Agbongbo-Akala. He was the hero of
            inter-tribal wars around the 1930s and he gallantly fought to defend
            the people against slavery and oppression. The Lisabi festival is
            celebrated to recognize and appreciate his fearlessness and
            gallantry. History has revealed that Lisabi, the great Egba hero,
            did not die but intentionally vanished into the earth in a forest
            between Maroko and Abatan villages in Obafemi Owode Local Government
            Area; the place is known as ‘Igbo Lisabi’ (Lisabi forest). The
            forest is bounded in the west of the Ogun River and the south of the
            Tegbelu stream. -Advertisement- Lisabi festival is an annual event
            held in March amidst pomp and pageantry. The festival attracts
            visitors and tourists from far and near.

        <p class="list-heading">3. Olumo Festival</p>
        <div class="article-cont">
          <div class="festival-article-cont">
            Olumo Rock in Abeokuta occupies a significant historical aspect in
            the life of the Egba people, particularly for serving as a
            formidable fortress during the days of Yoruba internecine wars. The
            rock, a gigantic outcrop of granite formation, was what gave them an
            edge over their adversaries as it served both as 'observation post'
            with vantage target range and impregnable 'bunker' for Egba
            warriors. Thus till today, whenever the annual Lisabi Day is held, a
            visit to this rock is a must by the Egba people led by their monarch
            and other high chiefs such as Oluwo, Apena among others.
            <p class="lisabi">
              Lisabi was an Egba General reputed and respected for his military
              deftness and battlefield bravado. The visit to the rock top is in
              fact the climax of the weeklong celebration. Atop the rock, the
              nostalgia of the war period is usually invoked with the joyful
              rendition of the ancient Egba national anthem, which in many ways
              shows the evergreen significance of the rock to the people. The
              closing stanza of the anthem goes thus: "Mayo Mayo Mayo O Lori
              Olumo, Mayo Mayo Mayo O Lori Olumo...", which means "I will ever
              be happy atop of Olumo." Libations would then be offered and
              prayers for peace and progress of Egba sons and daughters, Ogun
              State, Yoruba race and Nigeria as a whole would be said. After
              this, the royal father and his chiefs would depart, perhaps, to
              the palace or their different abodes.
