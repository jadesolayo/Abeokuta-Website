            Abeokuta, town, capital of Ogun state, southwestern Nigeria. It is
            situated on the east bank of the Ogun River, around a group of rocky
            outcroppings that rise above the surrounding wooded savanna. It lies
            on the main railway (1899) from Lagos, 48 miles (78 km) south, and
            on the older trunk road from Lagos to Ibadan; it also has road
            connections to Ilaro, Shagamu, Iseyin, and Kétou (Benin). Abeokuta
            (“Refuge Among Rocks”) was founded about 1830 by Sodeke (Shodeke), a
            hunter and leader of the Egba refugees who fled from the
            disintegrating Oyo empire.The town was also settled by missionaries
            (in the 1840s) and by Sierra Leone Creoles, who later became
            prominent as missionaries and as businessmen.

              In 1817, the Oyo Empire dissolved into civil war. Refugees
              displaced by the collapse of Oyo joined with the Ijebu in their
              war against the Owu in southern Yorubaland, which had broken out
              around the same time. Following the fall of Owu in around 1822,
              the leading Ife and Ijebu generals returned to their respective
              homes, but the rest of the armies that had allied with the Oyo
              refugees were invited by the Ijebus to Ipara, which they made
              their headquarters for further attacks against several towns in
              the region. This group then turned their attention to waging war
              with the Egba, a loose confederacy of towns that had been
              established by Yoruba migrants in the 13th century and were spread
              throughout the forested land between Ipara and Ibadan. The group
              conquered and destroyed many of these towns, eventually settling
              in one of the villages that had not been completely destroyed,
              Ibadan, which they used as their headquarters for additional
              conquests.At least a handful of Egba groups had by this point
              joined the group of marauders, and they too were living at Ibadan.

          Conflict between the various groups arose, and in one incident, an
          Egba chief named Lamodi shot an Ife chief named Ege to death with a
          pistol at a public meeting before himself being killed in the ensuing
          commotion. Fearing Ife reprisal, most of the Egba population withdrew
          as a group to an encampment about 3 or 4 miles distant on the other
          side of the Ona River. Here they enlisted Sodeke to be their leader
          and migrated to a hilly area known as Olumo Rock, where they
          established the town of Abeokuta around 1830 at what was then a small
          farming village. By 1825, Olumo Rock was already a place of refuge
          from Ibadan and Dahomey slave hunters; people were scattered
          throughout the landscape, taking shelter among the rocks surrounding
          the settlement. The Egba who established Abeokuta were soon joined by
          other Egba refugees and a substantial number of Owu who had escaped
          their captors. It became a busy metropolis and home to the majority of
          the Egba. However, the various groups of Egba did not fuse into a
          single community; rather, Abeokuta functioned more as a "federation of
          communities within a town wall than a community in its own right".
          Because Abeokuta was in a key location for the palm oil trade and
          because it was the so-called capital of the Egbas, Dahomey soon became
          hostile. In the 1851 Battle of Abeokuta, the Egba defeated King Gezo
          and the Dahomey incursion. They again beat back the Dahomey military
          in 1864. Aerial view of Abeokuta in 1929 The 1860s also saw problems
          arise with the Europeans, namely the British in Lagos, which led to
          the Egba first closing trade routes, followed by the expulsion of
          missionaries and traders in 1867.Between 1877 and 1893 the Yoruba
          Civil Wars occurred, and Abeokuta opposed Ibadan, which led the king
          or alake of the Egba to sign an alliance with the British governor,
          Sir Gilbert Carter. This occurred in 1893, which formalized the Egba
          United Government based in Abẹokuta which became recognized by the
          United Kingdom.In 1914, the Egba lands were incorporated into the
          colony of Nigeria by the British, with Abeokuta as the provincial
          capital.In 1918, an uprising took place, the Adubi War, which was
          related to the levying of taxes and the policy of indirect rule by Sir
          Frederick Lugard, the British Governor-General.[2] This was the only
          internal threat to British control of Nigeria during the course of the
          First World War.[15] The Abeokuta Women's Revolt, led by the Abeokuta
          Women's Union (AWU), took place in the 1940s. It was a resistance
          movement against the imposition of unfair taxation by the Nigerian
          colonial government.[16] In 1976, Abeokuta became the capital of the
          newly created Ogun State.
